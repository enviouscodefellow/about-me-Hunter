  <p>My name is Hunter and i was born and rised in Reno, NV from 96 - 15. From here i left for the military for 6 years. I never continued my education while in the service, so now im busting to learn code every day. I have worked retail, customer service/crowd control, and did the military for 6 years. My Goal is to keep learning and pushing in the course and learn more about the industry. Cause like me joining the military i did not know what I was Signing up for.</p>
